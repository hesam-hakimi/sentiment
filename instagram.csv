2908612466,user-reviews,"I have had a frustrating issue for several months now where certain features either make the app crash suddenly, or do not work entirely. One feature that does not work at all. Not a single time... is the ability to post multiple photos in a singular post. I’ve tried with just 2 photos. I’ve tried with the maximum amount of photos in a photoset(10). Not a single time has this worked. After adding a caption with some hashtags, tagging friends, and waiting for the post to load. It fails to post every single time. I’ve tried this on both my old phone iPhone 6S plus, as well as my most recent phone purchase the iPhone X. This feature has never worked for me, often times being so frustrated I’d neglect the app for a few days and then find myself back. After attempting to delete the app as well as the app cache and reinstalling on both phones the feature is still inoperative. I also agree with many other Instagram users that the feed is very annoying that I’ll see posts I’ve seen already, or posts from several days ago. Chronological order?? If Instagram was more oriented on creating a seamless working application they may have a lot more users, or more frequent users of the app. Every bug I’ve experienced, I’ve submitted through the in app report a bug.",2018-07-14T23:01:13Z,4,andrew_colin_,False,Maintenance
6452483722,user-reviews,"Instagram is perhaps the application I use the most, and I really enjoy it when it’s at its best. However, the flaws are simply overwhelming at times. I’m writing this review because my account has been wrongfully shadow-banned and action blocked over 6 times now without an actual just cause for it. Every time, it says I was allegedly “sharing my account with a service that helps me get more likes and followers” even though that’s blatantly untrue. I have 0 posts, 0 likes and well under 1000 followers. I have written 4 detailed reports explaining my situation but it has been to no avail. Every time this happens, I’m forced to change my password, I’m logged out of my account and then I’m action blocked for an entire week. Every time I try to like or comment, it gives me the option to report it if I believe they have made a mistake but nothing works. My account is never checked, my week long action blocks are never reduced or lifted, my reports are never acknowledged and I’m always getting wronged. I also really dislike the fact that I cannot easily contact anyone from Instagram to help me with issues like these, I can only leave long, written reports for you to ignore and do nothing about.

6339638129,user-reviews,"The app works for what it needs to work as. But for whatever reason, the user interface constantly changes and there is absolutely no indication that it is meant to change in their version history updates. It becomes slightly irritating that the app will work one way one day and the next some random change will be made to either the explore page or the home page that just doesn't make sense based off of its history. My example right now would be the new reels that were introduced. Now when I go on the explore page there is a huge portion of it being taken up by reels that I don’t want there. Sure, reels is cool but I went to the explore page, not the reels page. Another example that also happened recently was where I opened the app one day and my home page didn’t show any of the pages I followed and instead showed random pages. It took me a minute until I realized I had to click on “see older posts” before I could see the old posts. Not that I care for this too much, but it was just irritating for no reason to suddenly have pages I don’t follow showing up in the section of the app meant for only pages that I follow. That’s about all I can remember but there has been a history other similar changes in the past as well that I vaguely remember.",2020-08-20T02:32:02Z,3,ropetapetite,False,"Good social media app, bad user interface design"
3738007240,user-reviews,"Overall I love the app instagram, you can see funny videos and even gain followers on there, but here is the biggest problem on instagram, THEY ARE DELETING ACCOUNTS THAT DID NOTHING WRONG. Instagram needs to get out of their brain dead state and start checking accounts before deleting them because they are getting reported and accounts are being banned and disabled. This is especially unfair to the fan editors out there. There are hundreds of thousands of people who make edits of their favorite people on apps such as TikTok, Instagram, etc. These fans work hard on their edits, tag the people they edited, try to make their day by showing how much they love them just so instagram can delete the photos and videos because they assume that they are trying to be them??? Clearly if you read the caption you can clearly see that they are just simply showing how much they love that user. They are not trying to be like them they are just trying to support them. If they think people who show love to who they support then why don’t hate pages get banned, reported, or disabled? This isn’t the only people instagram has done this to because a nice dancer who did absolutely nothing wrong got disabled at 300k, the followers she worked hard on getting!!! Instagram needs to step up their game and stop doing all this bad stuff to these people who show their support or I’ll just have to be one of the many people who delete this app.",2019-02-06T03:05:57Z,1,lit_lana,False,Is instagram deleting people for doing nothing?

I went to my App Store downloaded instagram next I clicked create new account, I entered my email address and chose my password then click next, the next window 
Gave me the option to leave my email address as my instagram account name I didn’t so I changed it and then clicked next then the page glitched out and said that something went wrong and there was a button that said go back so I did that and I took me to the beginning to create an account so I entered my email clicked next and it said that this email already exists so I go to instagram app clicked on log in enter my email and password clicked log in and I get a message that my account was closed because I violated the terms and condition. I’ve actually tried again to create an account 2 days later using my work email and it did the same thing again. Idk what I’m doing wrong but I’m annoyed and done with instagram, that I’m just going to stick with Snapchat.

Maybe if people want to hide all the “ig models” they like you can add a setting to hide just YOUR stuff from your followers “following activity”. The only logical reasoning is people want to hide what they like, give them the option to do that on there own.

another big thing i’m really struggling with though is the sudden strike downs on content posted by other accounts. many accounts have either been threatened to be deleted or have actually been deleted while doing nothing wrong. i frequently talk about social injustices and yet for some reason literally HALF of my content gets marked as “hate speech” what is THAT about?? i’ve seen this happen to a lot of other accounts as well! and yet i see so many other accounts that actually DO post hateful things and even when i report their accounts instagram ALWAYS comes back with a “support request denied! this account has not shown any signs of hate speech”. while i do think that it’s great that instagram is focused on regulating these types of things now, it almost feels as if the people that are actually spreading good information are being heavily targeted as opposed to the actual hateful people on this app. and the worst part of this is that instagram never actually gets back to you when you request support for a piece of content that you were wrongfully marked down for, so many people whos accounts have been deleted have no way of getting it back. please review this system. it’s very flawed, and it’s so frustrating.",2020-12-09T13:43:47Z,1,Your adopted.,False,bad updates

I wish I could attach a photo to this review, but I hope my explanation makes sense.

6978261996,user-reviews,"I've been using instagram since 2012, and I used to love the platform so much. However recent changes in the functionality of the app have been making me consider fully deleting my account. First the algorithm was changed from seeing most recent posts first to posts you interact with most, which makes it so you don't see over half of the content from creators you're following and your followers don't see your posts. Then this new update replaced the notification and post tabs with reels and shop, which seriously effects it's usability. Now my notifications and post buttons are in an awkward hard to reach spot, instead of being easily accessible. Everyone I've asked have agreed that this new update is terrible, and that NO ONE cares or asked to have a whole shopping section on a photo sharing platform. This update feels like Instagram is desperately trying to pull users from other apps like TikTok and Pinterest instead of focusing on its own user base and their wants. I am so incredibly disappointed in Instagram's team for consistently refusing to acknowledge their user's concerns. If this update isn't reversed and/or if more terribly inconvenient updates are released, I'm definitely going to be leaving the platform. Furthermore, try implementing useful updates such as being able to reorder or remove photos from old posts. I think such feature would resonate well.

6714260762,user-reviews,"Huge decline here. It’s never been particularly impressive (to me) as a photos tool, but there WAS a critical mass of users which meant that you could reliably expect your social group to be there somewhere. Not anymore; in my experience, at least a dozen friends, in the past 12 months, have outright deleted IG AND Facebook simultaneously, suggesting strongly that IG is not an app that’s “killer” enough to overcome the tsunami of Facebook deletions. There are 2 dozen other photo apps in the iOS store at present with more features, better integration, faster processing & less battery drain than what you can find with Instagram. iPhone’s photo editing tools are so much superior to IG that it sort of baffles me why anyone with a modern handset would want to use those features. Even though I only ever perused this app for maybe 5 minutes per week by the time I cancelled, its battery consumption was routinely in the top 10, per the phone’s metrics. In fact, upon a quick check now, I see that despite deleting the app early this week, it *still* managed to book a 2% consumption of my weekly battery usage, which I’m sorry, but that blows me away. 

What on earth was this app doing to my handset in the background?!

In those 7 years, the notification/activity tab has been in the right corner, just left of the account button. So it baffles me as to why someone would feel the need to move it to the most unconventional place possible.

2973012330,user-reviews,"Overall, Instagram is an excellent social media app. However, I have found a few flaws in the way Instagram looks. For example, the comments are not in chronological order;making them very confusing. I have found a similar problem in the feed algorithm. They are not in chronological order anymore. You will see a post from 2 weeks ago, and then a post from 2 DAYS ago. Next, there should be a bigger time frame for videos. You cab only have a video that is 1 minute long. I wanted to post a slime review, but the video was 2 minutes long so I had to do it in 2 separate videos even though all of the slimes came together. Finally, I think you should fix the messages. You can always see if someone has seen your direct message. This isn't exactly a problem, but I think there should be an option, in case someone does not want people to know when they have seen their messages. Please take these suggestions into consideration. I know I am not the only person complaining about these things. Other than those problems, I have only had good experiences with Instagram. It is very easy and fun to use.

6659669281,user-reviews,"This new update has rendered the app essentially unusable. Ever since it was bought by Facebook, the UI has tanked severely, and isn’t user friendly anymore. The new positions of the buttons do not make any sense, the posting mechanism is hidden along with stories and reels, the DM system is 10x worse (trying to swipe out of a conversation can sometimes make you reply to a specific message which is completely unnecessary and unused), and at this point, I see more advertisements than I do my friends posts. The only reason any of these updates happened was because 1. Instagram wanted to make more of a profit by changing out the “notifications” section with “shopping” (a feature that most people don’t use) in order to bump up traffic revenue and 2. They changed out the “new post” button with “reels” as a way to compete with Tiktok. No one wants to do their shopping on Instagram, and if we wanted to use Tiktok, we would. Everyone who has been posting to reels has just been reuploading their Tiktoks, not making any new content purely for reels.

 Another thing is the hashtag following (or whatever it is 🤷‍♀️). For me personally, I’ve never used this. I tried it once and just thought it was annoying cause the posts would go on my feed, and I’d be thinking that I’m just following these accounts when I wasn’t. It really isn’t the greatest feature to me, as I could just go to my explore page and find the same posts.
Regardless of these minor things though, I still use Instagram pretty much every day. 😂 It’d just be nicer if these issues were resolved or taken into account by me writing this.",2018-12-21T16:07:25Z,4,🌼Caitlyn🌼,False,Needs Some Improvement

I can’t see posts in chronological order, I have “suggestions” on the feed which I go to see ONLY what the people I’m following have been up to. That’s been slightly annoying, but now in the explore feed when I click on one post with the intention to scroll through all the posts suggested to me from various users... instead I’m met with only one users posts, most of which I’m not interested in and it’s annoying to have to go back and click the next picture to see the next meme or what-have-it, causing me to close the app and open FaceBook or Twitter instead as they aren’t making changes that are majorly affecting the way users browse content. I don’t know who instagram has put in charge of these updates, but every single update gets worse. ALSO not to mention, the app will automatically follow accounts that I have either never encountered or had no interest in following. I have never left a review in the AppStore but Instagram used to be my favorite social media outlet and now I’m much more fond of other things due to some of the updates and I think a lot of people might feel this way about the path instagram is taking.",2017-12-17T05:24:44Z,3,Aperralll,False,Please stop making unnecessary changes

However I don’t know if this is a fluke or apart of the update. A message came up saying Instagram limits how much likes we can do on comments at a time to stop bullying... I just want to know who thought this was a good idea. This is a social media app that’s like the whole point, liking is literally the foundation of every media. If you have a limit whether your intentions are bad or not your going to end up being wiped for existence. And also I don’t know who thought a limit on liking comments would prevent bullying but that person has obviously never really been bullied in their entire life because that does nothing. The only thing limiting likes is going to do is leave Instagram with bad rating and have your audience delete the app and go to another platform that allows them to do what social media is suppose to be able to do. Speaking of such I won’t delete the app yet because I’m hoping this is a fluke but I will be switching to another platform, for the rest of the month, that is able to do its job.

This would be great for photographers like me who go out on photoshoots and want to put up one post with their best photos. It is hard to do that when all of your photos are cropped the exact same way. It should be the same way as Facebook. I am not saying we make Instagram exactly like Facebook because they are two different social medias, but I think it would be nice if we could upload photos on Instagram the same way we can upload them on Facebook. With Facebook you have one post with multiple pictures that are all the original sizes. You can then click on them and look through them individually before exiting and going through the rest of your feed. Instagram should allow us to have the option to upload our photos like this.

I can speak from experience because I have watched my likes go down as Instagram has changed their algorithm. People like things which are unique! Keep Instagram different and unique and make other platforms want to be like you, not you wanting to be like them. If the changes are based off of Statistics, realize the functions of other apps. Snapchat for instance, people like it simply because it is very private. On Instagram you are able to send pictures to people however they can be uploaded from the camera roll and used to look like the picture was taken just then.. this makes Instagram very user friendly for catfishes. Just keep the traditional Instagram aspects and forget about conformity. Make it so dm pictures- if uploaded from camera roll, it states that.

I like to think of it as my digital journal, but now it feels like a task to even navigate and find posts that I genuinely want to see. Consider that maybe not everyone wants to be invaded with things to buy even if it is targeted to us, it is unecessary because if we truly need a product we know exactly where to get it without the need of Instagram invading our experience. Instead of cultivating posts you think I would like, leave it up to me the human to make those decisions. I like to think for myself. And what’s up with changing the chronological order of posts? What sense does it make to cycle in and out older posts from users. It is not useful, people like to feel in control. Instagram used to be a cool platform to literally EXPRESS and only that!

I started posting again and realized my hashtags didn’t work because now they shadow banned me because (and I’m guessing) they believed my account was a bot. This got me mad but my account was still thriving so I did not care. They than started deleting some of my post claiming it went against their guidelines which I read later on and saw that it didn’t.i also made a promotion with one of my vids and had no problems and the next time I tried doing it with the same vid They said it went against there ad policy.

It honestly irks me to see how my hard work to draw and post almost every day is now basically all for nothing because everything is being handed to the bigger accounts. Smaller accounts are now butted to the side and ignored. There is almost no was of growing. I use hashtags, my story, and I posted regularly— yet my numbers still decreased with the new update. I feel like it is their way of saying “don’t promote? Don’t grow.” Sorry but not everyone is able to pay for that mess. I just wish everything was fair like it used to be. Why do big app developers always ruin something that was going so good? How can anyone else make it when they aren’t given the chances the bigger accounts once were given?

Please, backtrack and return it to how it used to be. I’ve had many other artists also complain and get discouraged because they feel the same way.

4537427915,user-reviews,"Instagram is a great app that I use on a daily basis, I love it and i’ve had it multiple years, but there are some changes that would make this app go above and beyond that me, and many others, would appreciate. First off, after you post multiple pictures in one post, you should be able to delete some pictures out of the post without having to delete the whole post. This would make so many users more happy because there are countless times when you accidentally post one picture in a group of pictures that you don’t like, but you didn’t realize it in time and you already have many likes and comments so you don’t want to delete the whole post and you just stay stuck on what to do. Also, if you creators made a way to preview certain pictures on a private account that the creator of the account puts up that would be amazing! It’s difficult to tell who some people are sometimes when you are only able see their profile pic so if you were able to select a few pictures from camera roll to put up (no likes or comments involved) it would be a huge help.

 Thank you creators for the amazing app:)

I don’t exactly understand why the “create post” button was replaced by the reels button; I get that it is probably to promote reels, but there are much better ways to do that, such as put it in the place where the “create post” button is right now, or put it in the drop-down menu in the profile section. I also feel the same way about the heart button moving, because as someone who never uses shopping on Instagram, I would much rather look at who liked my most recent post(s) rather than whatever shopping shows me. Secondly, Instagram needs to stop ripping off other social media apps; I don’t know if this is because it was bought out by Facebook, but Instagram took the biggest details of Snapchat, TikTok, and Facebook, and miraculously managed to find a way to meld them into their app. It’s obvious that Instagram’s company is taking these ideas so people would use their app more, but I feel like people would use the app if it was more unique.

Unfortunately, with each update, I’ve been having a harder and harder time both reaching out and seeing other people’s posts. Especially with the latest one — now, my main feed cuts off at all unread posts, and gives me a curated stream of recommended posts, which isn’t what I look for on my main feed. I’m looking for the people I actually follow and want to see content of, even if it’s old content! Old posts are now on a separate page that I can only find if I reach the end of my unread feed, and they’re not even sorted by time posted. Popularity-based algorithms that try to predict what I want to see inevitably make it harder for small creatives to reach out to their communities, and only make viewers have even easier access to accounts that already are popular.

I greatly enjoy using Instagram, as a creative and as a user, because of the easy access to a feed of other artists that I am already following — I don’t have this easy access anymore.

So not only does Instagram restrict accounts they don’t like or consider popular but will also remove some of your most active followers to keep your content from being seen. They act as if they are too good to be true but are really setting themselves up to less than MySpace in a few years.

I really suggest switching to Vero The True Social App! Been there a few months and I love it. Plus, they aren’t as strict as Instagram and you see content from all the people you follow.",2018-12-30T08:39:55Z,1,MissV_3,False,Instagram is a bully

All the updates have just been going downhill since the chronological order of your feed was removed. My feed is a mess of the same people over and over again with posts from many days ago because instagram thinks I want to see that stuff above everything else. The ""solution"" was to help you stay up to date with the posts you miss, but now I am missing more posts in my feed than before because of this system. I recommend making it an option in settings to turn on chronological order of your feed, it would make things so much easier. Another issue I have is that I recently noticed that the accounts you follow are no longer in chronological order either? There seems to be no organized way they are put in order, it's just like it was randomly thrown in there like that. This proves to be very difficult for me to find accounts I have recently followed as they no longer show up at the top of my followed box. I am following over 1,600 accounts so I have a very hard time remembering the name of an account I just followed. I just wanted to find one account and now it's lost in the many accounts I follow.

A lot of people don’t even shop on instagram like that, and god forbid you accidentally press on post that’s promoting a product that you’re not in to remotely, instagram will never forget and just keep and keep promoting it and things like it to you, even if you click “not interested”. 
Having the reels feature be on the explore tab was perfectly fine, there’s no need to have an entire tab for it, ESPECIALLY TO REPLACE THE POSTING TAB? The reel tab doesn’t even show you things based off who you follow sometimes, sometimes I literally get recommended 7 year old’s tiktoks and it’s so weird. I never get recommended a small account of something i’m into, it’s always a random child or middle schooler and it weirds me out. 
Notifications should always be more accessible than the shopping tab, I understand that a lot of people buy things off of tiktok, but that’s what tiktok is for, if they’re buying those things off tiktok they’re not going to think “what if they have the same product on instagram?” They’re just going to buy it off tiktok.

Even clicking on my own post from notifications if someone likes it does the same thing. Another thing is I keep getting notifications from the same post, sometimes hours later. Also, another horrible problem is if somebody sends me a post from a private account that I don’t follow, and then I start following that account, even after I get approved it still says in the dms “this is a private account follow them to see this message” so I don’t know what post was sent to me.

Honestly the changes you’ve been making make me not want to use the app anymore, some new features are nice but some are a complete failure. Horizontal scrolling works fine for stories but making stories and posts feel like the same thing is dumb and you still have to scroll vertically when you go to someone’s grid so why make the app feel even more disjointed?  Now you essentially have four different interfaces, one for ig tv, one for user pages and discover, another for stories and a slightly different one now for the home and they all function differently.

It honestly feels like you haven’t tested this because across the app people are complaining and also, for users who make posts with multiple images, it’s a nightmare because you already use horizontal scrolling for that but now you have to be careful not to tap the wrong part or you’ll scroll past the post or be stuck on the post when you intended to do something else.

So I deleted it and went on the App Store and searched up Instagram and it was gone , so I changed the filter to “iPhone only ” STILL didn’t show up . So at this point I was very upset , and I couldn’t think of what to do then finally it hit me , I should look on my purchased app history . So I looked up “ Instagram ”
And what do I get in response “ NO RESULTS this is not an app you have ” and I was just thinking really because if I recall I had it less than a minute ago . So I just searched up Instagram again and I saw this app that said “where your kids are hanging out” so I pressed on that and I scrolled down and it said suggested apps “Instagram” and “Snapchat ” , so I am very confused why Instagram decided to take away all of the stories from me , and then try to hide the app or something ???? So I am just very confused and they definitely need to figure something out and FAST!!!",2018-07-04T02:37:48Z,1,annabelle keasling,False,I am mad
6556119820,user-reviews,"Instagram is supposed to be safe for what? Age 12 and up, right? Well it’s not. There are plenty of inappropriate accounts and sexual nudity which Instagram doesn’t remove. Instagram favors accounts with followers. Smaller accounts with nudes can be removed, but when it’s an account with 20k or more, they do nothing. So if you are a minor or a younger child, be careful. There are a lot of inappropriate images that when scrolling through insta will pop up. It’s not ur fault if they pop up either, it’s not like I search around for these accounts! Instagram isn’t safe for younger people. Really disappointed in you instagram👎🏻 I literally just saw an account come up with a post of the woman in bed completely naked(nothing on at all) in a sexual pose with just her nipples covered by the way she was laying on the covers. It makes me furious seeing posts like that, knowing that there are young boys on the app who are going to end up falling into a sexual fantasy. Even if that wasn’t an issue, the fact that that is allowed on the app is absurd and outright inappropriate. Our culture today is a mess! If you are a parent viewing this, I recommend you child to have a private account that you keep an eye on.  I personally enjoy posting on my account and keeping track of social events that happen in my life, but there is so much inappropriate posts that I come across all the time.",2020-10-20T19:19:54Z,1,KarisLovesAnime,False,You lost my respect

I do tattoos for a living and all of my clientele comes from people who email me after seeing my page of Instagram . People from all mover the world get to see my work and know who I am . Instagram came out when I started tattooing and what a blessing that was .I've been able to network with other artists and announce to public when I’d be in different states doing a guest appearance at other shops . It’s important not to get obsessed with your like and followers but they should also keep you motivated to keep leveling up in whatever your presenting on Instagram .

But anyway I reported the Music Tag issue awhile back but haven’t heard back since then, so I reported the issue several times back to back to see if that works (prob not).

I’d start to unfollow people again and would get blocked from doing it again. Currently anytime I do anything on Instagram I still get the message saying my account is blocked from doing the action because I have shared my profile on a site that increases my followers and likes, which is not allowed in the Instagram community. Now this message is not really true, as Instagram encourages you to share your posts on Facebook. And I have my Instagram link on Facebook.

1886005879,user-reviews,"I've read a few other reviews and many of the stories also seem to apply to me. I've been using Instagram for years and I loved how it was a relevant social media platform that's not completely bogged down by ads and politics.

I loved being able to see what my friends and family are up to in a visual medium, which used to be the entire point of Instagram. Then, they started featuring more and more ads and the more they pushed with the ads, the less I would visit the app. However, around this time they also changed the feed algorithm, no longer sorting it by the most recent post, so whenever I go on it, my entire feed is at least 10 days old. I no longer enjoy scrolling through my Instagram feed, because instead of being able to immediately interact with the photos, I need to check the date on each one first. Scrolling through the feed has become a chore and as a result, I only visit the app about once a month now. I've debated deleting my account multiple times and if they do not revert back to the old algorithm soon, I probably will because I can't justify keeping an app on my phone that I don't use it enjoy.

At the very least, I can understand some ads here and there because companies need revenue, but I implore Instagram to please listen to millions of their users and sort feeds by recency again.",2017-10-30T18:56:16Z,1,gpapazian,False,New algorithm is killing this app
7222612507,user-reviews,"Hi, so I really love Instagram, but it might be nice to have a feature where you can disable your view of the like button (AKA you, as the person posting something, don’t have to see how many people like your post).  I struggle with a lot of perfectionism and social anxiety, and so I tend to hold a lot of my personal value in how many likes I get on a post I make.  It would just be nice to not have “how many people like this” be the reason I choose or don’t choose to post something, or have it become criteria for my self worth.  But, this isn’t to say that people can’t actually “like” my post.  They still could, it’s just that I wouldn’t be able to see it.

Also, it would be lovely to be able to disable the explore page of Instagram for certain times of the day.  I spend hours, and I mean HOURS, on the explore page avoiding and procrastinating my work.  I like having the app around on my Home Screen, I just would like to not feel like as soon as I open it I am going to waste the day scrolling.  I know the whole point of an app is to have people use it, but I think I would use it in a much healthier way if I had the option to place restrictions for myself within the app.",2021-04-14T21:11:00Z,4,Awesome bug 2001,False,Just some suggestions

I, along with many other accounts do not find this to be helpful or beneficial for Instagram accounts. Instagram has unfortunately made it so easy to buy followers, and this can be a very dangerous thing. There are surgeon accounts, banking accounts, makeup accounts, marketing accounts with hundreds of thousands of fake followers. They buy these fake followers in order to seem more reputable. What these scammers, a lot of the time, fail to notice, is that the like counts and the followers don’t match. Me personally when I am on Instagram, I see a lot of promotion posts for makeup courses from “famous” makeup artist, but these makeup artist are just stealing pictures and tricking people. The “likes” being displayed is a great way to immediately locate a fake “famous” Instagram account and prevent scammers from taking information from your users. At the end of the day they’re just likes. It doesn’t hurt anyone to see the likes, but it does hurt to not see them. PLEASE KEEP THE LIKES AVAILABLE TO SEE!! If it offends people that much it would be great if there was an option for accounts to turn off their ability to see other people’s like numbers and theirs.

First off, the bottom of the screen did NOT need to be touched at all, and the fact that you put reels and the shop there make no sense when you proved that you could’ve just put them in the top right where the old stuff is.
Second, it feels like you change the UI every month.  It’s impossible to get used to navigating this app because how things work constantly change. Also, having the explore page seep into your main feed makes no sense.  I have several accounts but one of my smallest ones with 40ish people who constantly post so that there would ALWAYS be something on my feed has maybe 5 of them show up consistently and the rest lost to the aether or having their posts show up days later.
You’ve made it nearly impossible for smaller pages to grow because of algorithm shifts that just smother tiny accounts or accounts that don’t post multiple times a day, and you put a huge bias on accounts that already get a ton of engagement.

It would be so much easier if you were able to access your photos in month to month folders for each year. Because 8 years later, we have an online photo album of our life from those years, that’s ALWAYS going to be there for you to access. So even when I’m 70 I can look back at my 20’s.

4588412415,user-reviews,"Instagram’s idea of a “good user experience” is not making it a good time. Their great plan to make posts out of chronological order is where it starts, I suppose. It makes no sense that I can only see posts in my feed from people I interact with most—I don’t have time to scroll through my entire feed, but I pretty much only see about 20 of the accounts that I follow, no one outside those because I can’t “interact” with them. How will I interact with these if i cannot even see their posts? 

Regarding posts—Instagram is supposed to be a photo and video sharing app, and the quality is downright terrible. Photos are grainy, videos never load, the list goes on and on. I’m here to share my art, and seemingly, it gets more and more difficult to reach others of the trade. When I first started in 2015, more people could discover me. Now, no one can and it’s an absolute mess. If Instagram truly wanted to “improve user experience” it would. And it’s not, rather going for select posts the app *thinks* you’ll like. I can like a variety of things, so show them all to me.

And there’s a bug that’s personally ruined the entire app for me which is hard to describe but if you send someone a picture the picture will remain at the bottom of your chat where your most recent message should be and this gave me anxiety/caused me to respond to messages late and ultimately led to me deleting the app. A calling feature would be nice too so you don’t have to go onto two completely private accounts and start a live together.",2018-06-09T00:05:32Z,3,TessaSwagstar,False,"Great, buuut...."

Use this as a business platform, and engage with sizable audiences. 2. Those who simply may want to alter their feeds content as their tastes have changed, and are now left with no recourse in doing so. Secondly, removing the number of likes being viewable to all on a post should be an option, not mandatory. If a user wants to have their likes hidden let them, but don’t force that again on business platforms, who need to boast numbers to increase engagement, same goes with private influencers. Third, why stifle independent app developers of 3rd party applications, they simply are trying to enhance our experience of instagram for us, because of the extreme limitations being imposed as of late. 3rd party applications should indeed be slowed to manage and integrate with the original application to cultivate a more robust social experience.
