What a joke .... when it finally downloaded, the stakes \u0026 amounts at your table are RIDICULOUS. You practically force people to spend money to buy chips not going to do it, deleted the app. Deleted instagram too; we were better off over 40 years ago with payphones \u0026 vinyl records."

Edit: Got annoyed I subscribed on YouTube Facebook and Instagram and gained maybe 3 brushes out of the 20 brushes that you can unlock and I didn't even get the ones that I wanted. With the brushes that are available most of them in the doodle section its a good responsive app with nice textures . The inactive brushes look the same as the active ones making it annoying. Pay yearly or monthly to unlock its OK then

Just the wrong press of a button deletes everything I've been working on for the past 10 minutes. The buttons or slides are too touch sensitive and are hard to use. OR the buttons don't work and you can't get back out to finish the photo. I was also not impressed how the app resized and squished my text on Reels. So I'll keep importing from a different app.

Yes I've uninstalled and reinstalled a few times..didn't help."

I was just trying to scroll down on the instagram and it just threw me out promptly of the application like a boomerang , afterthat I tried to go back to instagram then I faced an issue that is of not playing any video . Furthermore, I also checked my internet connection and it was thoroughly working out , but none of the video is playing and I am incapable to spend my time into valuable thing . Fix this problem as soon as possible."

Since sometime yesterday, my entire app is nonfunctional. The timeline won't load, I can't even edit my own profile, I can't see stories other than my own but even then I can't post on it. And right before, I could see photos, but it wouldn't let me like them and wouldn't load the comments. I'm not sure what happened, but this app used to be great. I used to use it all the time."

Also, people I have followed don't show up except for today's posts. So if they have posted 2 or 3 days ago, I can't find them unless I go to their post history. The app just feels broken on the home screen. I hope they fix this soon. Before I forget the app to the computer do not update together and the web browser feels even more broken. Disappointed"

Just the wrong press of a button deletes everything I've been working on for the past 10 minutes. The buttons or slides are too touch sensitive and are hard to use. OR the buttons don't work and you can't get back out to finish the photo. I was also not impressed how the app resized and squished my text on Reels. So I'll keep importing from a different app.

Depending on your device it's going to run less or more smoothly but it runs effortlessly on my Xiaomi Mi 10. My only note to the developer's (An trust me guys as a developer myself it's a pain in the *as) is to make it easier to see the photos you have favored without going into your phones folders and also maybe provide a feature to overview some photos with longpress like instagram allowes you to do nowdays. Other than that it's a perfect app!!

It says I have to enter my phone number, which I did, and then they sent a code to make sure. It said the code was sent but it never came. I never saw the code. So I tried making a new account but I couldn't because it said, Please Try Again Later. I tried again a few hours later and it said the same thing. So now I can't use the app. I tried uninstalling it then installing it again but that didn't work. Please fix this"

It wasn't doing this before so I'm guessing the servers are just having issues or an update of the app has caused this.

Just the wrong press of a button deletes everything I've been working on for the past 10 minutes. The buttons or slides are too touch sensitive and are hard to use. OR the buttons don't work and you can't get back out to finish the photo. I was also not impressed how the app resized and squished my text on Reels. So I'll keep importing from a different app.

I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I've cleared the cache and data on both the phone and the app. I've reported this problem to Instagram 3 days in a row with no response. At this point 1 star is too many. *UPDATE* This is day 6 and still no change with my account and no response from INSTAGRAM. *UPDATE* This is now day 7 and still nothing has changed.

It doesnt matter if u change the pass the info is still saved on the devices that needs to go asap! Too much people are getting hacked. The security system is trash too. I think a face id option to log in would be very helpful

Pictures include: account images, posts, and stories. I don't know what is happening but its been like this for about 3 weeks (I noticed that this is happening to multiple other people as well). It's basically useless now. Other users are telling you about this problem and you, as a company, still aren't fixing it."

I have 3 accounts, first it happened to my personal account, but my other two worked fine. Then it just happened to my art account. And my other fine is starting to act funky too. I've tried literally everything. Reinstalling, restarting my phone, restarting the wifi, trying mobile data, clearing cache, logging out. Nothing works. Please get this fixed this is super annoying."

I cant use hashtags unless I put them in one at a time on my stories. Editing profile to add features never works properly. Every time I try to use something on this app is never ever works.

For the last 2 days it says can not refresh feed and it will not load anything. My connectivity is fine and everything else on my phone works. Super dissapointed.

I think a lot of them are good, some are meh, and some I don't agree with at all. However, I believe that they've overall done a good job with the app. Some things I wish were better were the descriptions you can write underneath photos, I think that Instagram could very much revamp that section for easier formatting. I would also appreciate the ability to edit comments and a 'save as draft' button I could press for posts."

At this point 1 star is too many. *UPDATE* This is day 6 and still no change with my account and no response from INSTAGRAM. *UPDATE* This is now day 7 and still nothing has changed.

My account won't refresh anything and I'm left with blank screens now. I've done my own troubleshooting and even reported the problem in the app but with the lack of customer support it feels hopeless. Seeing as I'm one of many experiencing this problem, I can only hope it's gets fixed because to me, a problem like this not being resolved is a disgrace to social media."

However, this doesn't happen for videos I shoot. It is immensely irritating to realise that none of the picture taken were saved. I tried clearing the cash, afterwards installing the app, but nothing seems to work. I hope this problem can be solved easily and in a short period of time."

In my life i never worked and checked in different platform but i worked in tiktok for almost 1 mouth they never give me a chance always the others who never do anything and meanless. This app is way to overrated and bad. I don't recommend starting your video or watching either. Instagram is way better than this app. Thank you all anyone who read this have a nice day.

It's basically useless now. Other users are telling you about this problem and you, as a company, still aren't fixing it."

And i also tried to make a new account but it is showing some kind of network error.

I get notifications that friends have updated stories (if I get them at all to begin with) only to go and see it's something I've already seen or there's nothing there at all. The notifications lag like crazy. I think the only ones that work properly are notifications for actual posts but even so it's hard to tell.

A girlfriend and a boyfriend), Then for these two person, there should be a feature which will allow to see the chat of any particular date in just one click. Explanation:- If I am chatting with a person daily since (say 1April) and today its 9 may. It will be really hard for me to get to the chat when we spoke(chat) for the first time (1April). So the feature is needed to see chats of any date in 1 click."

I think a lot of them are good, some are meh, and some I don't agree with at all. However, I believe that they've overall done a good job with the app. Some things I wish were better were the descriptions you can write underneath photos, I think that Instagram could very much revamp that section for easier formatting. I would also appreciate the ability to edit comments and a 'save as draft' button I could press for posts."

I don't see a reason why would you delete all the messages and make it look like the chat was recently started when actually there are a lot more messages from way before that are now gone and that were maybe important to someone. I had a lot of valuable messages and chats saved on my account and now i don't have access to them. I want my messages back and i really hope you'll fix that as soon as possible. This now is so awful it makes me mad.

All time it shows in my account (choudharyfaiez) couldn't refresh feed although I have a good internet connection. I tried uninstall and re install it but it is not working. And i also tried to make a new account but it is showing some kind of network error.

It doesnt matter if u change the pass the info is still saved on the devices that needs to go asap! Too much people are getting hacked. The security system is trash too. I think a face id option to log in would be very helpful

I use to use Instagram as my primary but since all the problems I've had to Uninstall it. Mostly because it started affecting my Android phone which is not old or was it used. I can't access my accounts because when 1 locks up you can't switch back! So f#\u003d$ u ig I'm am actually pissed because we trust them to do the job right and protect out personal info and their integrity of programming this also includes our memories bastards!

Yes, you can pinch to zoom and maybe read the text in an image, but it immediately returns when you let go. If the text is clear, but too small to read in one zoom, too bad, you can't zoom in further. Fingers in the way? To bad, move the picture and try again To read the images, you will need to screenshot and zoom in photos, making the Instagram app less than redundant, it is an impediment."

I get notifications that friends have updated stories (if I get them at all to begin with) only to go and see it's something I've already seen or there's nothing there at all.

Explanation:- If I am chatting with a person daily since (say 1April) and today its 9 may. It will be really hard for me to get to the chat when we spoke(chat) for the first time (1April). So the feature is needed to see chats of any date in 1 click."

If the text is clear, but too small to read in one zoom, too bad, you can't zoom in further. Fingers in the way? To bad, move the picture and try again To read the images, you will need to screenshot and zoom in photos, making the Instagram app less than redundant, it is an impediment."

I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I've cleared the cache and data on both the phone and the app. I've reported this problem to Instagram 3 days in a row with no response. At this point 1 star is too many. *UPDATE* This is day 6 and still no change with my account and no response from INSTAGRAM. *UPDATE* This is now day 7 and still nothing has changed.

An hour later,i receive a notif that they added a story again. I clicked it but it was just the previous story i saw. Please fix this. You're better than this."

Yes, you can pinch to zoom and maybe read the text in an image, but it immediately returns when you let go. If the text is clear, but too small to read in one zoom, too bad, you can't zoom in further. Fingers in the way? To bad, move the picture and try again To read the images, you will need to screenshot and zoom in photos, making the Instagram app less than redundant, it is an impediment."

It doesnt matter if u change the pass the info is still saved on the devices that needs to go asap! Too much people are getting hacked. The security system is trash too. I think a face id option to log in would be very helpful

So the feature is needed to see chats of any date in 1 click."

When you save a draft, the photo looks resized, but when you open it again and decide to use the created draft, the photo is resized by the app back to the original size and it cannot be enlarged, for example. Why is this happening?"

What used to be a good and enjoyable, has turned into a nagging social disorder. Every thing that is posted by my friends will not play in the latest version of this app. All ads and suggestion work faultlessly. It appears that the app is processor sensitive. So all those with intel processors are sold short by poor programming. If you have an intel tablet don't bother with this app."
