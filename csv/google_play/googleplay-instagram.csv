What a joke .... when it finally downloaded, the stakes \u0026 amounts at your table are RIDICULOUS. You practically force people to spend money to buy chips not going to do it, deleted the app. Deleted instagram too; we were better off over 40 years ago with payphones \u0026 vinyl records."

With the brushes that are available most of them in the doodle section its a good responsive app with nice textures . The inactive brushes look the same as the active ones making it annoying. Pay yearly or monthly to unlock its OK then

Just the wrong press of a button deletes everything I've been working on for the past 10 minutes. The buttons or slides are too touch sensitive and are hard to use. OR the buttons don't work and you can't get back out to finish the photo. I was also not impressed how the app resized and squished my text on Reels. So I'll keep importing from a different app.

Control freaks!!! The app is ok and has potential, but it's annoying. Also, I've got it set on dark theme, but it glitches to white and when it does the text becomes impossible to read. Yes I've uninstalled and reinstalled a few times..didn't help."

I was just trying to scroll down on the instagram and it just threw me out promptly of the application like a boomerang , afterthat I tried to go back to instagram then I faced an issue that is of not playing any video . Furthermore, I also checked my internet connection and it was thoroughly working out , but none of the video is playing and I am incapable to spend my time into valuable thing . Fix this problem as soon as possible."

Since sometime yesterday, my entire app is nonfunctional. The timeline won't load, I can't even edit my own profile, I can't see stories other than my own but even then I can't post on it. And right before, I could see photos, but it wouldn't let me like them and wouldn't load the comments. I'm not sure what happened, but this app used to be great. I used to use it all the time."

Also, people I have followed don't show up except for today's posts. So if they have posted 2 or 3 days ago, I can't find them unless I go to their post history. The app just feels broken on the home screen. I hope they fix this soon. Before I forget the app to the computer do not update together and the web browser feels even more broken. Disappointed"

I don't see a reason why would you delete all the messages and make it look like the chat was recently started when actually there are a lot more messages from way before that are now gone and that were maybe important to someone. I had a lot of valuable messages and chats saved on my account and now i don't have access to them. I want my messages back and i really hope you'll fix that as soon as possible. This now is so awful it makes me mad.

Just the wrong press of a button deletes everything I've been working on for the past 10 minutes. The buttons or slides are too touch sensitive and are hard to use. OR the buttons don't work and you can't get back out to finish the photo. I was also not impressed how the app resized and squished my text on Reels. So I'll keep importing from a different app.

Depending on your device it's going to run less or more smoothly but it runs effortlessly on my Xiaomi Mi 10. My only note to the developer's (An trust me guys as a developer myself it's a pain in the *as) is to make it easier to see the photos you have favored without going into your phones folders and also maybe provide a feature to overview some photos with longpress like instagram allowes you to do nowdays. Other than that it's a perfect app!!

My problem is on one of the resent updates something to do with recipes posting for videos I can't really click the to go to the website so I can view the recipe and print it. I dont want to watch a video of recipe that plays like a story of Facebook or Instagram. There's still regular pins. But I generally love this app.

Just the wrong press of a button deletes everything I've been working on for the past 10 minutes. The buttons or slides are too touch sensitive and are hard to use. OR the buttons don't work and you can't get back out to finish the photo. I was also not impressed how the app resized and squished my text on Reels. So I'll keep importing from a different app.

Previously this was never an issue with me but now everytime I share my reels in my story it becomes old tv. Very blurred, audio and video sync goes missing...even audio gets weird at times! Please fix the bug or whatever issue it has"

My account won't refresh anything and I'm left with blank screens now. I've done my own troubleshooting and even reported the problem in the app but with the lack of customer support it feels hopeless. Seeing as I'm one of many experiencing this problem, I can only hope it's gets fixed because to me, a problem like this not being resolved is a disgrace to social media."

It builds your likes and dislikes analysing these records, keeps experimenting by showing you new images, Quote: s, videos tries to catch your attention.That's how it starts controlling your mind, you keep coming back to get a dopamine hit !"

I think a lot of them are good, some are meh, and some I don't agree with at all. However, I believe that they've overall done a good job with the app. Some things I wish were better were the descriptions you can write underneath photos, I think that Instagram could very much revamp that section for easier formatting. I would also appreciate the ability to edit comments and a 'save as draft' button I could press for posts."

It takes 24+ hours to finally show up in my gallery and even then sometimes it doesn't show up at all. This makes the instagram camera practically useless for me. I like the app but it has SO MANY GLITCHES ALL THE TIME."

I don't see a reason why would you delete all the messages and make it look like the chat was recently started when actually there are a lot more messages from way before that are now gone and that were maybe important to someone. I had a lot of valuable messages and chats saved on my account and now i don't have access to them. I want my messages back and i really hope you'll fix that as soon as possible. This now is so awful it makes me mad.

You can create Instagram posts, YouTube thumbnails, etc. through this. One thing which made me give it 4 stars rather than 5 is it's tough to move things. Like I am using my finger to move but instead it opened keyboard to type. This happens sometimes other than that it's very amazing !"

Yes, you can pinch to zoom and maybe read the text in an image, but it immediately returns when you let go. If the text is clear, but too small to read in one zoom, too bad, you can't zoom in further. Fingers in the way? To bad, move the picture and try again To read the images, you will need to screenshot and zoom in photos, making the Instagram app less than redundant, it is an impediment."

It doesnt matter if u change the pass the info is still saved on the devices that needs to go asap! Too much people are getting hacked. The security system is trash too. I think a face id option to log in would be very helpful

I would also appreciate the ability to edit comments and a 'save as draft' button I could press for posts."

It doesnt matter if u change the pass the info is still saved on the devices that needs to go asap! Too much people are getting hacked. The security system is trash too. I think a face id option to log in would be very helpful

I would also appreciate the ability to edit comments and a 'save as draft' button I could press for posts."

At this point 1 star is too many. *UPDATE* This is day 6 and still no change with my account and no response from INSTAGRAM. *UPDATE* This is now day 7 and still nothing has changed.

It doesnt matter if u change the pass the info is still saved on the devices that needs to go asap! Too much people are getting hacked. The security system is trash too. I think a face id option to log in would be very helpful

For the last 2 days it says can not refresh feed and it will not load anything. My connectivity is fine and everything else on my phone works. Super dissapointed. I updated the app and uninstalled and reinstalled and still the issue persists. Probably my favorite app of all time before this. Extremely dissapointed.

I tried restarting my phone, exiting and reopening the app, and uninstalled it and reinstalled it but none of my messages are coming back.

It also keeps on repeatedly showing me old stories as new, and it is also hiding some new stories from me. I'm afraid I will have to give it a 1 star unless the issue is resolved."

It's limiting my ability to do things like sharing, following, unfollowing, commenting, ect. The ads are getting worse, and more money hungry. Ontop of that, it's harder to get my posts through and onto other pages. This sucks because I've been using Instagram since 2019, and Ive been debating if I should just delete it or not. üò©‚úã Don't download Instagram, especially u struggling artists."

All time it shows in my account (choudharyfaiez) couldn't refresh feed although I have a good internet connection. I tried uninstall and re install it but it is not working. And i also tried to make a new account but it is showing some kind of network error.

This came all of a sudden and I have not been able to use the app since this morning which is really annoying. How do you manage to have a different issue every other day like come on. Stop adding updates if this is the outcome

A girlfriend and a boyfriend), Then for these two person, there should be a feature which will allow to see the chat of any particular date in just one click. Explanation:- If I am chatting with a person daily since (say 1April) and today its 9 may. It will be really hard for me to get to the chat when we spoke(chat) for the first time (1April). So the feature is needed to see chats of any date in 1 click."

It builds your likes and dislikes analysing these records, keeps experimenting by showing you new images, Quote: s, videos tries to catch your attention.That's how it starts controlling your mind, you keep coming back to get a dopamine hit !"

It takes 24+ hours to finally show up in my gallery and even then sometimes it doesn't show up at all. This makes the instagram camera practically useless for me. I like the app but it has SO MANY GLITCHES ALL THE TIME."

I think a lot of them are good, some are meh, and some I don't agree with at all. However, I believe that they've overall done a good job with the app. Some things I wish were better were the descriptions you can write underneath photos, I think that Instagram could very much revamp that section for easier formatting. I would also appreciate the ability to edit comments and a 'save as draft' button I could press for posts."

My account won't refresh anything and I'm left with blank screens now. I've done my own troubleshooting and even reported the problem in the app but with the lack of customer support it feels hopeless. Seeing as I'm one of many experiencing this problem, I can only hope it's gets fixed because to me, a problem like this not being resolved is a disgrace to social media."

I do buy coins \u0026 other specials too.I done use Instagram or some of the other features. Not so much fun any more. Hard to keep up with all the changes?

Edit: Got annoyed I subscribed on YouTube Facebook and Instagram and gained maybe 3 brushes out of the 20 brushes that you can unlock and I didn't even get the ones that I wanted. With the brushes that are available most of them in the doodle section its a good responsive app with nice textures . The inactive brushes look the same as the active ones making it annoying. Pay yearly or monthly to unlock its OK then

I don't see a reason why would you delete all the messages and make it look like the chat was recently started when actually there are a lot more messages from way before that are now gone and that were maybe important to someone. I had a lot of valuable messages and chats saved on my account and now i don't have access to them. I want my messages back and i really hope you'll fix that as soon as possible. This now is so awful it makes me mad.

It doesnt matter if u change the pass the info is still saved on the devices that needs to go asap! Too much people are getting hacked. The security system is trash too. I think a face id option to log in would be very helpful

If the text is clear, but too small to read in one zoom, too bad, you can't zoom in further. Fingers in the way? To bad, move the picture and try again To read the images, you will need to screenshot and zoom in photos, making the Instagram app less than redundant, it is an impediment."

The audio works fine, but the video will pixelate and flash like a strobe light between going black and showing the vid in mixed up pixels, which can easily cause seizures in some individuals.

I think a lot of them are good, some are meh, and some I don't agree with at all. However, I believe that they've overall done a good job with the app. Some things I wish were better were the descriptions you can write underneath photos, I think that Instagram could very much revamp that section for easier formatting. I would also appreciate the ability to edit comments and a 'save as draft' button I could press for posts."

I've done my own troubleshooting and even reported the problem in the app but with the lack of customer support it feels hopeless. Seeing as I'm one of many experiencing this problem, I can only hope it's gets fixed because to me, a problem like this not being resolved is a disgrace to social media."

The audio works fine, but the video will pixelate and flash like a strobe light between going black and showing the vid in mixed up pixels, which can easily cause seizures in some individuals. One update seemed to mostly fix it, but then the next update totally ruined it and made it even worse. Giving it 1 star until this issue is fixed. This can be physically damaging to some people."

Words and buttons get cut off to the side. This has never happened before. Before the update, the app refused to refresh my feed, and after the update the post section doesn't even fit my screen. I can't even post properly anymore, since the layout doesn't fit, it doesn't work properly."

What used to be a good and enjoyable, has turned into a nagging social disorder. Every thing that is posted by my friends will not play in the latest version of this app. All ads and suggestion work faultlessly. It appears that the app is processor sensitive. So all those with intel processors are sold short by poor programming. If you have an intel tablet don't bother with this app."

Only problem I'm facing is while uploading the stories there is always some black space showing in my screen below the uploaded content. Even when I watch someone else's story that black space is always there.

I'm tired of it now, either I'll close it permanently or I want a solution now."

What used to be a good and enjoyable, has turned into a nagging social disorder. Every thing that is posted by my friends will not play in the latest version of this app. All ads and suggestion work faultlessly. It appears that the app is processor sensitive. So all those with intel processors are sold short by poor programming. If you have an intel tablet don't bother with this app."
