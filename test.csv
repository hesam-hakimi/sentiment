6548452309,user-reviews,"Instagram has made changes that have mistakenly deactivated thousands of users from accessing their accounts - including mine. They have deactivated for ‚Äúbreaching terms of conditions‚Äù without any warning sent to the users or reason. You just get a generic message and are left wondering what you did.  

Now, the issue is if you ever need help from Instagram, there is NO way to contact their help centre. It is the actual worst. All of their help just loop you to their FAQs but don‚Äôt actually provide any help in recovering accounts that were deactivated by Instagram unfairly and without reason. 

If you check their Twitter posts, read all the comments. Hundreds of users desperate to try to reach Instagram taking to Twitter, or spamming fb to try and get help. 

And the worst ? NOW REAL hackers and scammers are taking advantage of these desperate people and offering ‚Äúhacker accounts‚Äù to get their accounts back. Charging real money and then gaining access to banking info. Why are these con artists not deactivated for breaching policy??

There is a HUGE error going on, with zero communication from Instagram. No acknowledgement. No timeline on when these users can get their accounts back. 

So be warned. Delete all third party apps that log in to your account because that is what can trip up their automated system to just disable your account with no warning.  It thinks you are using bots automatically and will keep you in the dark for weeks to months. 

Instagram, I‚Äôve really lost my trust in this platform. Unacceptable lack of customer service and acknowledgement. I hope more people speak up about this.",2020-10-18T15:06:32Z,1,KRH___,False,The worst customer service. Have lost faith in trusting Instagram

In fact, Tamils in Sri Lanka had a huge protest called Pothuvil to Polikandy (P2P) and many social media platforms stayed quiet and ignored this. These hashtags are used to spread awareness on what is really going on in Sri Lanka. Tamils are killed, raped, striped from their families and theres many more as the list never stops.

6911092484,user-reviews,"Used to love instagram. It was easily my main app and I checked it several times daily for the last seven years. My decision to delete the app occurred after several recent disturbing incidents.

 I recently saw an account with deeply Anti Semitic memes appear as sponsored content in my feed. The meme featured a star of david and a bacteria cell with a little girl pointing at the star of david. The caption read ‚Äúbecky point to the greater danger‚Äù. 

I reported the meme to instagram twice only to receive a report that the meme was not appraised to be racist. I was unable to take any other meaningful action and unable to receive any other explanation for how this content appeared in my feed.

Whats particularly disturbing to me is that instagram added this account to my feed without my permission. Previously I had seen ads appear in my feed. Fair enough. The idea that deeply prejudiced memes could appear in my feed as sponsored content is really distressing to me. 

Additionally, I recently encountered a ‚Äúyou‚Äôre all caught up‚Äù message. After which my feed is filled with accounts I do not follow. I am unable to see posts by friends or family. I used to enjoy this app as a way of connecting with loved ones. Now i‚Äôm just looking at strangers. At a time where its hard enough to see friends and family, this decision is selfish and disappointing on instagrams part.

This sucks. Really used to love the app and I‚Äôm sorry to move on. This is not the same app I opted into seven years ago. I would not recommend it to friends or family going forward.

This app is no longer what was originally intended for and just another shopping and advertising app. I can‚Äôt wait for the next new Instagram like app to be developed that‚Äôs not as commercialised as this stupid app. I might as well go on Amazon, or watch the Kardashians or maybe watch tik toks... because that‚Äôs what Instagram has become. :)",2021-01-24T23:41:43Z,1,kristina7891,False,Shopping App and a platform for influencers

It‚Äôs clear that Facebook and Instagram have been moving in the direction of focusing on features and ads where they can make more money but it‚Äôs unfortunate that the user experience has to suffer because of that. Many businesses use Facebook and Instagram to market and reach their customers but what happens when their customers have all moved on to using other apps? Users grow more and more frustrated with each major update that makes the platform less user friendly and that will push them to search for other apps to use as an alternative. 

I‚Äôd love to hope that Instagram would release an update that‚Äôs a happy medium of the new release and previous versions but that‚Äôs probably wishful thinking.

This would be understandable considering errors are bound to occur, but there is no way to contact Instagram with a guaranteed response to resolve these issues. This is dangerous for businesses, including the ones who spend ads to keep their own service running. Instagram doesn‚Äôt care as long as they keep making revenue. They removed likes in order to make people more ‚Äúfocused on content rather than people‚Äôs engagement.‚Äù Let‚Äôs be honest. That‚Äôs useless because it takes from the dopamine rush that made Instagram what it is. People will continue to find things to judge, including the number of comments. As Instagram progressively updates their algorithm, further limiting recognition opportunity for smaller accounts, they will begin to experiment more openly with social media. Instagram is becoming a cage, milking dollars out of people, and lowering the engagement for the ones who refuse to spend money.

Posting images and videos also adds the ""Instagram version"" into my camera roll, which I do not want. It also doesn't work well with my iPhone 11's aspect ratio and posting images will always have sides cropped out, either making them look ugly or incomplete. It also demands camera and microphone access, which I have consistently denied so far. When enabled, you can't set the camera and microphone access to be disabled by default when entering a video chat, so they basically took away my access to some important privacy options. Instagram is also hella broken on Windows 10. The website is like half-working and the app on the Microsoft Store has the same issues.

I appreciated losing the numbers under posts, but moving notifications to a hidden button next to DMs, and replacing it with a marketplace? Oh my god I have never hated a move by a company this much since Big Oil's anti-climate propaganda in the 70s. And I wasn't here for that.

The entire app's design is no longer about the creator. It HIDES budding creators, burying them underneath people who are trying to sell me things, and now the marketplace function (something I NEVER asked for, and neither did anyone I know) makes me want to throw my whole phone out. Instagram is not a mall for me. It used to be a place for me to get exposure to all kinds of art, ideas, and people. I literally hate this stupid marketplace button so much.

ON TOP OF THIS, there's an account that's been using my photos to bait users into paying for porn. Every single person I've ever known has reported this account, and I've even sent a private email to Instagram begging them to take this account down. Nothing. It's goddamn embarrassing for a company with so much power behind it. If your information is compromised or your photos are being exploited for perverts to use to make money, DO NOT TRUST INSTAGRAM TO PROTECT YOU. They are protecting their profits, and clearly they're playing the short game because those profits ain't gonna last long when you lose your early adopters after so many years like this: not with a bang but with just an excruciatingly slow death.",2021-04-11T14:56:22Z,1,ayyyhooriah,False,Let's monetize until everyone leaves the app
